## mlh-starter-kit
This is a super simple starter pack made during MLH INIT 2022. This pack uses Bootstrap as a launch point.

## How do I use this?
You should clone this repo (or download it as a .zip file) to your computer. If you download it as a .zip you'll need to uncomrpess (open) it. You can then open the folder in any code editor, including VS Code and Atom.

There are lots of example files in the repo. Feel free to change or remove them!
